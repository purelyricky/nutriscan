# NutriScan User Guide

Welcome to NutriScan! This guide will help you get started with extracting nutritional information and allergen data from your food product documents.

## What is NutriScan?

NutriScan is an AI-powered tool that automatically reads food product PDFs and extracts:
- **Allergen information** (gluten, milk, eggs, nuts, etc.)
- **Nutritional values** (calories, protein, fat, carbohydrates, etc.)
- **Ingredients lists**

No more manual data entry - just upload your PDF and let AI do the work!
